# DrugLaunch
Educational game on how to launch a new molecule on the US healthcare market.

DrugLaunch is an educational game intended to help the player learn about how to successfully
launch a new Oncology treatment on the US healthcare market. 
The game navigates the player through 3 main decision-making processes when launching a
new drug: negotiating with payers, coming up with a marketing plan, and determining
appropriate drug supply. The player earns a score 0-4 for the choices they make in each phase
of the game (0 being the best score and 4 being the worst score). At the end of the game, the
player learns whether they successfully launched their drug or not depending on their total
score across the 3 phases of the game. If they weren’t successful, the player will learn about
which area they need to work on most (i.e. which area they received the worst score). In order
to test the project, download DrugLaunch.py from Github and use the terminal to run “python
DrugLaunch.py.” The game will begin automatically and will instruct the player on how to play
as they go.
